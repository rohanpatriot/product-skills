## Continuous Interviewing

**Purpose:** Maintain weekly contact with customers to sustain a fresh understanding of their needs, pain points, and desires.

**Prerequisites:** A defined outcome to focus interviews. Access to customers or prospects. A recurring calendar slot.

**Steps:**
1. Set a recurring weekly interview slot (same time every week)
2. Automate recruiting — set up an in-product prompt, a Calendly link, or a recruiting service
3. Target customers relevant to your current outcome
4. Conduct one interview per week (minimum) with the full product trio present
5. Use the story-based interviewing technique (see below)
6. Synthesize immediately after using the interview snapshot technique

**Expected Outcome:** A weekly cadence of customer interviews generating fresh opportunities for the Opportunity Solution Tree.

**Variations:** If you can't get weekly interviews, start with biweekly and build toward weekly. If the full trio can't attend, rotate members so each person attends at least twice per month.

## Story-Based Interviewing

**Purpose:** Extract real experiences from customers rather than opinions, preferences, or feature requests. Stories reveal what customers actually do, not what they think they do.

**Prerequisites:** A scheduled interview with a customer relevant to your outcome.

**Steps:**
1. Open with a specific story prompt — "Tell me about the last time you [did the thing related to your outcome]." Get a specific instance, not a generalization.
2. Follow the story — ask "What happened next?" to map the sequence of events
3. Dig into moments of friction — "You mentioned [pain point]. Tell me more about that."
4. Explore emotions — "How did that feel?" or "What was going through your mind?"
5. Ask about workarounds — "How are you handling that today?"
6. Close with future-oriented questions — "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?"
7. Do NOT ask: "Would you use a product that does X?" or "What features do you want?"

**Expected Outcome:** A detailed story revealing the customer's actual experience, including needs, pain points, desires, and workarounds.

**Variations:** For B2B, interview both the buyer and the end user — they have different experiences. For early-stage products, focus on the current experience (without your product) to understand the baseline.

## Interview Snapshot Synthesis

**Purpose:** Synthesize interview insights into a structured, shareable one-page format immediately after the interview.

**Prerequisites:** A completed customer interview. All trio members who attended.

**Steps:**
1. Within one hour of the interview, the attending trio members sit together
2. Fill out the snapshot template:
   - Quick facts about this customer
   - Opportunities identified (needs, pain points, desires)
   - Key quotes that illustrate opportunities
   - Experience insights (what we learned about their journey)
   - Surprises (what we didn't expect)
3. Identify 2-4 opportunities from this interview
4. For each opportunity, determine if it's a new opportunity or reinforces an existing one on the Opportunity Solution Tree
5. Update the Opportunity Solution Tree with new or reinforced opportunities

**Expected Outcome:** A one-page snapshot that captures the interview's insights and feeds directly into the Opportunity Solution Tree.

**Variations:** If the full trio wasn't present, share the snapshot with absent members before updating the tree. If you're doing multiple interviews per week, batch snapshot creation but don't wait more than 24 hours.

## Experience Mapping

**Purpose:** Create a visual map of the customer's end-to-end experience to reveal where opportunities concentrate.

**Prerequisites:** At least 5-10 customer interviews covering the relevant experience.

**Steps:**
1. Define the scope — what experience are you mapping? (e.g., "How customers currently manage their finances")
2. Identify the major steps the customer takes, in order
3. For each step, capture:
   - What the customer is trying to do (needs)
   - Where they struggle (pain points)
   - What they wish were different (desires)
4. Populate from interview data, not assumptions — every annotation should trace to at least one interview
5. Look for clusters — which steps have the most pain points? Which needs are unmet?
6. Use the map to identify the richest areas for opportunity exploration

**Expected Outcome:** A visual artifact showing the customer's journey with annotated opportunities at each step.

**Variations:** Start rough and refine as you do more interviews. The map should evolve over time. If the experience is very long, focus on the segment most relevant to your outcome.

## Opportunity Identification

**Purpose:** Extract distinct opportunities (needs, pain points, desires) from interview snapshots and experience maps.

**Prerequisites:** At least 3-5 interview snapshots.

**Steps:**
1. Review recent interview snapshots
2. List all needs, pain points, and desires mentioned
3. Deduplicate — merge opportunities that are essentially the same thing said differently
4. Frame each as a customer opportunity: "[Customer segment] needs/struggles with/desires [specific thing]"
5. Determine parent-child relationships — which opportunities are subsets of broader opportunities?
6. Place on the Opportunity Solution Tree under the relevant parent opportunity

**Expected Outcome:** A growing, structured set of customer opportunities on the Opportunity Solution Tree.

**Variations:** If you're just starting, accept that the tree will be thin. It fills out over weeks of interviews, not in one session.

---

## Opportunity Prioritization

**Purpose:** Select a target opportunity to focus solution generation on.

**Prerequisites:** An Opportunity Solution Tree with at least 10-15 opportunities across multiple branches.

**Steps:**
1. Review the tree and identify candidate opportunities (leaf nodes or specific-enough parent nodes)
2. For each candidate, assess:
   - **Frequency:** How many customers have this need/pain point?
   - **Intensity:** How much does it matter to them?
   - **Connection to outcome:** How plausibly does addressing this move our metric?
   - **Feasibility:** Is this something we can realistically address?
3. Compare candidates as a trio — use compare-and-contrast, not isolated evaluation
4. Select one target opportunity to focus on
5. Commit to this opportunity for a discovery cycle (typically 2-4 weeks)

**Expected Outcome:** A single target opportunity that the team will generate solutions for.

**Variations:** If the trio disagrees, use the criteria above to structure the debate. If no clear winner emerges, test your assumptions about the top two opportunities in parallel.

---

## Individual-First Ideation

**Purpose:** Generate diverse solutions by starting individually before sharing, to prevent anchoring on the first idea voiced.

**Prerequisites:** A clearly defined target opportunity.

**Steps:**
1. Restate the target opportunity so everyone is aligned
2. Each trio member independently generates as many solutions as possible (5-10 minutes, silent)
3. Use sketches, sticky notes, or short written descriptions — not polished proposals
4. Round-robin sharing: each person shares one idea at a time, rotating until all ideas are shared
5. Build on each other's ideas — combine, extend, modify
6. Generate a second round independently (the first round primes new thinking)
7. Share the second round
8. Group similar ideas together

**Expected Outcome:** 10-20+ solution ideas covering a wide range of approaches to the target opportunity.

**Variations:** If remote, use a shared whiteboard tool with hidden sections for individual ideation, then reveal simultaneously. If the trio is stuck, add constraints ("What if we had to solve this without any code?" "What if we had unlimited engineering time?").

---

## Dot Voting

**Purpose:** Narrow a large set of solution ideas to the top three for deeper evaluation.

**Prerequisites:** A set of 10+ solution ideas from ideation.

**Steps:**
1. Display all solution ideas visibly
2. Each trio member gets 3 votes (dots)
3. Vote silently — place dots on your top choices
4. Count votes
5. Select the top three vote-getters
6. If there are ties, discuss and break ties as a group
7. The top three solutions move to story mapping and assumption testing

**Expected Outcome:** Three solutions selected for deeper evaluation and comparison.

**Variations:** If the trio is larger (e.g., includes stakeholders), adjust the number of votes. The point is to efficiently converge from many ideas to a manageable set for comparison.

---

## Story Mapping a Solution

**Purpose:** Break a solution into a structured backbone of activities and steps to make it concrete enough for assumption identification.

**Prerequisites:** A selected solution from ideation.

**Steps:**
1. Identify the backbone — what are the 3-5 major activities in this solution?
2. Under each activity, list the steps the user would take
3. Order steps vertically by necessity — most essential at top, nice-to-haves below
4. Draw a line across the minimum viable version (the walking skeleton)
5. Review the walking skeleton — is this enough to test whether the solution addresses the opportunity?
6. Identify what's knowable vs. unknown at each step

**Expected Outcome:** A visual story map showing the structure of the solution with a clear minimum viable version identified.

**Variations:** Story map all three candidate solutions to make comparison concrete. This makes the compare-and-contrast evaluation more rigorous.

---

## Assumption Generation

**Purpose:** Surface the hidden assumptions underlying a solution so they can be tested before building.

**Prerequisites:** A story-mapped solution.

**Steps:**
1. Walk through the story map step by step
2. At each step, ask: "What has to be true for this to work?"
3. Categorize assumptions into five types:
   - **Desirability:** Will customers want this? Will they switch from their current approach?
   - **Viability:** Does this work for the business? Can we sustain it economically?
   - **Feasibility:** Can we build this? Do we have the technology and skills?
   - **Usability:** Can customers figure out how to use this? Will they use it correctly?
   - **Ethical:** Are there unintended consequences? Does this respect customer privacy and wellbeing?
4. Write each assumption as a testable statement: "We assume that [specific claim about the world]"
5. Place assumptions on the assumption map (importance x evidence)

**Expected Outcome:** A comprehensive list of assumptions categorized by type and mapped by risk.

**Variations:** Do this for all three candidate solutions. Compare their assumption profiles — a solution with fewer leap-of-faith assumptions may be the safer bet.

---

## One-Question Survey Testing

**Purpose:** Test a specific assumption quickly using a single-question survey deployed to relevant customers.

**Prerequisites:** A clearly stated assumption to test. Access to a customer segment.

**Steps:**
1. Identify the assumption to test
2. Craft one question that directly addresses the assumption
3. Define what results would confirm vs. disconfirm the assumption (set criteria before seeing results)
4. Deploy the question — in-product prompt, email, or intercept
5. Collect responses (aim for 30+ for statistical relevance)
6. Compare results to your pre-set criteria
7. Update the assumption map based on results

**Expected Outcome:** Evidence for or against a specific assumption, gathered in days rather than weeks.

**Variations:** This technique works for desirability and usability assumptions. For feasibility, use a technical spike instead. For viability, use a financial model or pricing test.

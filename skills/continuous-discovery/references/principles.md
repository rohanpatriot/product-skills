# Principles

Twelve guiding principles for effective continuous discovery. Each principle is a decision rule — when in doubt, follow the principle.

## 1. Weekly Customer Touchpoints Are Non-Negotiable

**Statement:** The team must talk to customers every week. Not every other week. Not monthly. Weekly.

**Rationale:** Customer understanding decays rapidly. Weekly cadence maintains fresh, accurate knowledge. It also builds the habit — when interviewing is optional, it stops. When it's a weekly commitment, it becomes part of the team's operating rhythm.

**Application:** Schedule a recurring weekly interview slot. Automate recruiting. Make it the trio's responsibility, not the PM's solo task. If you skip a week, diagnose why and fix the blocker.

**Counter-example:** "We'll do a research sprint next quarter" is not continuous discovery. It's a phase-gated research project that will yield stale insights by the time they're acted on.

## 2. Outcomes Create Focus and Autonomy

**Statement:** A well-defined outcome gives the team both direction and freedom. It says what to achieve without dictating how to achieve it.

**Rationale:** When leadership assigns outcomes instead of features, teams have the autonomy to discover the best solutions. This is more motivating for the team and more effective for the business — the people closest to the customer are making the tactical decisions.

**Application:** Negotiate an outcome you can directly influence. Make sure it's measurable. Revisit it if the business context changes. Use the outcome to evaluate every opportunity and solution — does this plausibly move the metric?

## 3. The Product Trio Must Have Direct Customer Contact

**Statement:** Product managers, designers, and engineers must participate directly in customer interviews. Secondhand research is not a substitute.

**Rationale:** When you read a research report, you get someone else's interpretation. When you sit in the interview, you hear the customer's words, see their body language, and notice things a report would omit. Direct contact builds empathy that no document can replicate.

**Application:** All three roles attend interviews, at least occasionally. If scheduling is hard, rotate who attends, but never delegate all customer contact to one person.

---

## 4. Explore the Problem Space Before the Solution Space

**Statement:** Map opportunities thoroughly before generating solutions. The quality of your solutions depends on the quality of your problem understanding.

**Rationale:** Most teams rush to solutions because solutions feel like progress. But a well-defined problem is half the solution. Teams that spend time in the opportunity space discover non-obvious solutions that teams fixated on solutions never consider.

**Application:** Build an Opportunity Solution Tree with a rich opportunity layer before you start generating solutions. The opportunity space should have at least 10-15 distinct opportunities before you start prioritizing.

---

## 5. Opportunities Are Discovered, Not Assumed

**Statement:** Opportunities come from customer interviews, not brainstorming sessions. Real needs, pain points, and desires live in the customer's experience, not in the team's imagination.

**Rationale:** Teams that assume they know the opportunity space build for customers they've imagined, not customers who exist. Interview-driven opportunities are grounded in reality.

**Application:** Every opportunity on your Opportunity Solution Tree should trace back to at least one customer interview. If you can't point to an interview where this opportunity surfaced, it's an assumption, not a discovery.

---

## 6. Structure Opportunities as a Tree, Not a Flat List

**Statement:** Opportunities have parent-child relationships. Big opportunities decompose into smaller, more specific opportunities. Structure them hierarchically.

**Rationale:** A flat list of 50 opportunities is overwhelming and unprioritizable. A tree structure reveals which broad areas are richest, lets you drill into specific sub-opportunities, and makes prioritization tractable — you compare siblings, not the entire list.

**Application:** When you add a new opportunity, ask: "Is this a child of an existing opportunity, or a new branch?" Group related opportunities under parent nodes. Prioritize at each level of the tree.

---

## 7. Generate at Least Three Solutions

**Statement:** For every target opportunity, generate at least three distinct solutions before choosing one. Never evaluate a single solution in isolation.

**Rationale:** Compare-and-contrast decisions are cognitively superior to single-option evaluations. When you compare, you notice trade-offs, you think more critically, and you're less likely to fall in love with the first idea. Three is the minimum for meaningful comparison.

**Application:** Use individual ideation before group sharing to avoid anchoring. Each trio member generates ideas independently, then shares. Combine and build on ideas. Dot-vote to select the top three for deeper evaluation.

---

## 8. Solutions Are Hypotheses, Not Commitments

**Statement:** A selected solution is a hypothesis — "We believe this solution will address this opportunity." It is not a commitment to build. Test the hypothesis before committing.

**Rationale:** Most ideas fail. If every selected solution becomes a committed project, teams waste resources building things that don't work. Treating solutions as hypotheses creates space for testing and learning before building.

**Application:** After selecting a solution, ask "What would have to be true for this to work?" Identify assumptions. Test the riskiest ones. Only commit to building after key assumptions are validated.

---

## 9. Test the Riskiest Assumptions First

**Statement:** Break solutions into assumptions, prioritize by risk (importance x uncertainty), and test the riskiest ones first.

**Rationale:** If the riskiest assumption is false, the solution fails regardless of everything else. Testing low-risk assumptions first gives you false confidence — everything looks good until you hit the fatal flaw. Front-load the hardest learning.

**Application:** Use assumption mapping to identify leap-of-faith assumptions. Design the smallest possible test for each. Run tests weekly. If a leap-of-faith assumption fails, pivot to another solution rather than trying to force the failed one to work.

---

## 10. Favor Simulated Environments Over Built Environments

**Statement:** Prefer assumption tests that simulate the experience over tests that require building the real thing. Fake doors, prototypes, concierge tests, and Wizard-of-Oz tests are faster and cheaper than shipping code.

**Rationale:** Building is the most expensive way to learn. Every test that doesn't require real code saves engineering time for the solutions that survive testing. Simulated tests can run in days; built tests take weeks or months.

**Application:** For each assumption, ask "Can I test this without building anything?" Use prototypes, landing pages, email campaigns, concierge service, or Wizard-of-Oz approaches before writing production code.

---

## 11. Small Bets Over Big Bets

**Statement:** Run many small tests rather than a few large ones. Small tests reduce risk incrementally and maintain learning velocity.

**Rationale:** Big bets are high-risk — if they fail, you've lost significant time and resources. Small bets fail cheaply. A rhythm of small tests (weekly or biweekly) keeps the team learning and adapting faster than competitors.

**Application:** Design tests that take days, not weeks. Test one assumption at a time. Use the results to update your Opportunity Solution Tree and inform next steps. Maintain a cadence of at least one test per week.

---

## 12. Discovery and Delivery Happen in Parallel

**Statement:** Discovery and delivery are not sequential phases. They run simultaneously, every week. While the team delivers this week's committed work, they're also discovering what to build next.

**Rationale:** If discovery stops during delivery, the team runs out of validated ideas and falls back to opinion-driven decisions. If delivery stops during discovery, nothing ships. Parallel operation ensures a continuous pipeline of validated opportunities feeding into delivery.

**Application:** Allocate time for both every week. Discovery activities (interviews, synthesis, ideation, testing) should be regular, recurring commitments alongside delivery work. Use the Opportunity Solution Tree to manage the handoff — solutions that pass assumption testing move into the delivery backlog.

## What Torres Would Not Say

- "Validate your idea" — validation implies confirming what you already believe; Torres emphasizes discovering what you don't know
- "The user" as a generic abstraction — Torres pushes for specific customer segments and real interview subjects
- "Ship it and see what happens" — discovery reduces risk before shipping, not after
- "Let's do a sprint of research" — discovery is continuous, not a sprint or phase
- "The PM decides" — the product trio decides together
